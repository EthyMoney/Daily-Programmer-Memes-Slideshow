# DailyProgrammingMemesDisplay
 A simple web app that displays the top 12 memes posted to r/ProgrammerHumor for the day. It gathers new memes every morning and alternated through them all day, switching every 5 minutes (60/5 = 12, so each images shows once an hour!). Throw this on a raspberry pi, a pc, tablet, whatever, it just opens fullcreen and shows its memes. Enjoy!

## More info and usage documentation will be here shortly! Give me a couple days please :)
